              <p>Following my graduation from Northwestern in March 2012, I worked for Young&Rubicam, an industry-leading advertising agency. My goal was to combine my interest in psychology with my innate management skills. While I enjoyed and thrived in the management role - attaining a promotion to a higher-level job on our biggest account, Colgate-Palmolive, within 9 months - I found myself unquestionably drawn to the digital side of life. I spent countless afterwork hours reading tech blogs and immersing myself in the startup world. After completing some of the CodeAcademy/CodeSchool levels, I knew that coding was the path for me. <br><br>I have spent the last 12 weeks in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program building Rails apps and honing my craft as a developer. </p>

                   Any trip onto the General Assembly campus will undoubtedly yield a stop at the GA Job Board, which seeks to extend and cultivate the GA community by creating a platform for students, alumni, and employers to communicate across. The web application features a dual sign-up and login portal for both students and employers, professional user profiles, as well as a multi-filterable search page for all student and employer job postings. As a student, you can browse job opportunities, connect with current and previous WDI and UX students, and post information about your credentials and interests. As an employer, you can post listings about employment opportunities and apprenticeship programs, browse talented students, and list potential projects for WDI cohorts  </h6>

                  <h6>This app was my first, my baby, and hopefully my biggest 4 day struggle. I started at the top of the moountain, and fell all the way down, hitting my head and bumping, scratching, breaking limbs and other parts that had never fallen so far before. But somehow, when I got to the bottom, I felt better than ever. I dusted myself off, and soon realized that all of these bumps, scratches, breaks and bruises would actually make climbing the mountain <em>easier<em>.

                  This app signs a user in, validates, then redirects to a welcome/enter page. A link takes a user to the next page, where they can search by full title or by keyword, and then parses from two different APIs - OMDB and TrailerAddict, succesively- to search for the movie trailer/poster/info. The query string enter into OMDB, which returns an imdbID, which then gets entered into a new query that parses based on a URL with the IMDB ID. Some videos donâ€™t work because the API is pretty garbage, but for the right movies it works.</h6>
